## Inspiration
I would like to do machine learning with the Bert model of HabanaAI for natural language processing. I also want to classify the images of animals so the machine can identify which image is which animal using the Torch 

## What it does
I want to train the machine using Bert model in HabanaAI. I also use the code to train machines to classify the images using the torch model. 

## How we built it
- Python
- Bert
- Torch

## Challenges we ran intoWe had issues to figure out the bug and how to make it work. We read the documents but we were still unable to figure out how to debug the error. If there are more training videos about Habana models and the use cases, that will be more helpful. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to set up the Habana machine image in AWS and ran the instances. We were able to develop an image classification model.

## What we learned
- We learnt about AWS
- We learnt about the relationship between Habana and AWS
- We learnt to set up instances in AWS

## What's next for AWS Habana Bert and Image Classification Training
We want to debug the error and learn more about AWS and Habana
